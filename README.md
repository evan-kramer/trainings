# Trainings

This repository contains training materials (heavily borrowed) for building analytical skills.

- __R Markdown__: R Markdown is useful for generating reproducible reports. 
	- This is especially useful when data change more often than the supporting text or structure. 
	- You can learn more about R Markdown [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) or download [this helpful cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) (or [this one](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)).
- __Git__: Git consists of version control software that uses the command line. It logs changes in code/files. 
	- GitHub is a code collaboration and version control website. 
		- There is a good overview [here](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) and [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
		- You can learn more about creating a GitHub account [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/types-of-github-accounts#personal-user-accounts).
	- On Windows machines, you'll also need to download [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), which is a command line interface for using Git and GitHub.
